## How to Install

You can simply install with command ```pip install PyBenchFCN```.
- Pre-request: ```numpy```, ```matplotlib```

## How to Use

### Classical Single-Objective Optimization

The input of each numerical optimization problem could be a 1-D ndarray, or 2-D ndarray.
- **1-D array**
  - an example of **a solution (individual)** for 10D problem is ```np.random.uniform(0, 1, 10)```, where each entry is a decision variable.
  - use ```f()``` to return a fitness value (scalar).
- **2-D array**
  - an example of **group of solutions (population)** for 10D problem is ```np.random.uniform(0, 1, (5, 10))```, where each row (totally 5) is an individual.
  - use ```F()``` to return an array of fitness value (1-D array).

#### Setup Benchmark Function

To set a benchmark function, one may see the sample code in ```Factory.py``` in the [repository](https://github.com/Y1fanHE/PyBenchFCN), or follow the script below. Also, there is a sample optimization program provided in ```sample.py```.

```python3
import numpy as np

# import single objective problems from PyBenchFCN
from PyBenchFCN import SingleObjectiveProblem as SOP

n_var = 10                                      # dimension of problem
n_pop = 3                                       # size of population

problem = SOP.ackleyfcn(n_var)                  # Ackley problem

'''same function as the code above
from PyBenchFCN import Factory
problem = Factory.set_sop("f1", n_var)
'''

print( np.round(problem.optimalF, 5) )          # show rounded optimal value

xl, xu = problem.boundaries                     # bound of problem

x = np.random.uniform(xl, xu, n_var)            # initialize a solution
print( problem.f(x) )                           # show fitness value as scalar

X = np.random.uniform( xl, xu, (n_pop, n_var) ) # initialize a population
print( problem.F(X) )                           # show fitness values as 1d-array
```

#### Plot Fitness Landscape

To plot a fitness landscape (2D space), one can use the code below. **Notice, this function only works for continuous SOPs.**

```python3
from PyBenchFCN import Tool
Tool.plot_sop("sphere", mode="save")            # plot and save landscape of Sphere function
Tool.plot_sop("schwefel", plot_type="contour")  # plot contour plot of Schwefel function
```
